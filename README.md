# Left 4 Recipy

You will find one `.vpk` file at the root which you will upload to the workshop or put in your addon directory directly

And a directory Left4Recipy which is the source of this mod. You need to drag & drop your mod foler (in this case : `Left4Recipy`) on the vpk.exe (You will find it at the root of the Left4Dead files.) It will generate a new `.vpk`
